# DirectDraw Transparency Test

Seeing black boxes around every sprite when you play Cave Story? Run this and let me know what you see.

...Even with this information, I'm not sure I would be able to get to the bottom of the issue...  
(I'm mainly just curious to know whether any of these sprites will show up with proper transparency)
